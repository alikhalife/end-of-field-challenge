# End of the field challenge
Group work by [Ali K](https://github.com/alikhalife) and [philouLeF](https://github.com/philouLeF)

## Mission

We have to reproduce [this landing page](https://www.figma.com/file/QW2bswyiiy8KFk68EbJnZU/Shade-Digital-Service-Landing-Page-(Community)?node-id=0%3A1) by using HTML, CSS and SCSS only

## Criteria for self-evaluation

### Git
- Commit regularly with useful messages
- Push at least twice a day
- Provide a README (hello)

### HTML
- It has to be valid and checked with a validator
- Lighthouse criteria are equal or more than 90%
- Good use of semantic
- Well indented
- Accessible

### CSS
- Use of SASS (with pleasure <3)
- Do not use framework
- Well organized and indented
- Use of media queries with smartphone, tablet and desktop interfaces
- Give meaning to classes name
- Consistent on Chrome and Firefox

### Results
- The final result is as close as we can to the mockup
- Fonts match
- Colors too
- Dimensions too (I guess...most probably)
